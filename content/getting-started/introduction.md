# Getting Started With Selector

Selector is an AIOps platform to help you effectively manage and troubleshoot your network, server, cloud, and application infrastructures.

The platform empowers you with instant, real-time actionable insights for the efficient management of multi-domain networks and application infrastructures. With Selector Analytics, you can significantly reduce Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), enhance IT performance & efficiency, and slash operational costs.

To accomplish this, Selector created an architecture that distributes functionality into four key areas, and then designed each abstraction layer with both performance and usability in mind. We considered every aspect of this problem, from the diversity of the data inputs, the guidance of the machine-learning algorithms, to the methods for data retreival and presentation of that data.

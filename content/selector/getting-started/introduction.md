# Getting Started with Selector

Selector Software's (S2) ML/AI platform is a powerful tool designed to automate and enhance the process of selecting and matching entities or items based on specific criteria. It leverages cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to provide intelligent and efficient solutions for entity matching tasks.

The primary function of the S2 platform is to analyze and compare various attributes or features of entities in order to determine their similarity or relevance to each other. These entities can include products, documents, profiles, or any other form of data that requires matching or categorization. Commonly, these entities will take the form of logging from network devices such as routers, firewalls, switches, etc. This includes data sources such as syslog, SNMP, openBMP, RestAPI, CRM tools and ticketing systems. Virtually any data source can be ingested by the Selector Software platform.

The S2 platform employs sophisticated algorithms and models to learn patterns and relationships within the data. It can automatically extract relevant information from input sources and transform it into a structured format for analysis. The product utilizes techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and statistical modeling to process and interpret the data.

Once the data is prepared (labeled), the S2 platform employs machine learning algorithms to train models that can recognize similarities and patterns within the dataset. These models learn from labeled examples or historical data to identify the most relevant features and create accurate representations of the entities.

The ML/AI product provides a user-friendly interface or API through which users can input their data and define their matching criteria. It allows users to specify various attributes, constraints, and rules to tailor the matching process according to their specific requirements.

Upon receiving the input data and criteria, the S2 platform applies the trained models to generate matching results. It compares the entities based on the defined features and provides similarity scores or categorization labels. The output can be further customized to meet the user's needs, such as generating reports, exporting matched entities, or integrating with other systems.

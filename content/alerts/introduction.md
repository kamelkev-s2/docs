Event-based Alerts
The S2 platform allows users to set up alerts based on specific events or triggers. These events can be predefined system events, such as reaching a certain threshold, exceeding a limit, or meeting a particular condition. Users can configure alerts to trigger based on these events to stay informed about significant changes or occurrences.

Customizable Alert Rules
Users have the flexibility to define their own alert rules based on their specific requirements. They can set up rules that combine multiple conditions, data filters, or calculations to trigger alerts when certain criteria are met. This customization allows users to tailor the alerts to their unique business needs.

The S2 platform offers various delivery channels for alerts and notifications, ensuring that users receive timely information in their preferred format. Common delivery channels include email notifications, SMS messages, in-app notifications, and integrations with messaging platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams.

Escalation and Notification Hierarchy
In scenarios where immediate attention is required, the S2 platform supports escalation and notification hierarchy. Users can define a sequence of recipients who should be notified in a specific order, ensuring that alerts are escalated to higher-level personnel if initial recipients do not respond or acknowledge the notification.

Configurable Alert Templates
Selector Software often provides predefined alert templates that users can utilize as a starting point for creating alerts. These templates may include common alert configurations for specific use cases or industry best practices. Users can customize these templates according to their requirements, saving time and effort in setting up alerts.

Historical Alert Logs
The S2 platform typically maintains a log of past alerts, including details such as the triggering event, time stamp, and recipient information. This log allows users to review the history of alerts, track trends, and analyze patterns to gain insights into system performance, data anomalies, or potential issues.

Alert Acknowledgment and Resolution
In some cases, the S2 platform may include features that enable users to acknowledge alerts and track their resolution progress. This feature helps users manage and prioritize their response to alerts and ensures accountability in addressing critical issues.

Overall, the alerting and notification features in S2 platform offer users the ability to stay informed about important events, changes, or conditions within the system. By proactively delivering notifications through various channels and allowing customization of alert rules, users can take timely action and make informed decisions to address critical situations or leverage opportunities.
